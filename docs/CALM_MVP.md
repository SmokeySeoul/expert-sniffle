# Calm MVP Philosophy

This document is the authoritative reference for Calm MVP product decisions and implementation.

## Calm-first UX principles
- Default to calm, predictable experiences; avoid urgency, streaks, or engagement pressure.
- Every action should be understandable at a glance with plain-language context.
- Surface only what is needed now; defer complexity until explicitly requested.

## “Nothing to do right now” is a success state
- The product should celebrate calm completion: no alerts, no nags, no gamification.
- Silence is allowed when there is nothing actionable or user-approved to present.

## Timeline-first mental model (time > lists)
- Time is the primary organizing principle; lists are secondary.
- Prioritize temporal clarity (what happens next, when, and why) over inventory.

## AI is assistive, gated, explainable, never automatic
- AI can explain, suggest, and summarize only with explicit user permission.
- Every AI outcome must be explainable and user-approved before changes apply.
- No background AI decisions; no hidden or silent automation.

## Trust over engagement, clarity over growth
- Favor transparency and user control over retention mechanics.
- If a choice is unclear, choose the more conservative, user-controlled path.

## North-star question
> “Does this make the user feel more in control—or more monitored?”

If a change fails this question, it does not ship.
